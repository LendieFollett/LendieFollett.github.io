## Nice to meet you
Dr. Lendie Follett is an assistant professor of business analytics in the College of Business and Public Administration at Drake University. She received her Ph.D. in statistics from Iowa State University where she also served as a statistical consultant. After graduation she spent a year in industry as a senior statistician at General Dynamics Information Technology. 

Professor Follett's favorite research projects are often interdisciplinary in nature and involve using data to answer complex research questions and make meaningful inference. She is primarily interested in Bayesian methods and computation. Most recently she has performed Bayesian analyses to investigate food insecurity and nutritional choices, stochastic volatility and jumps in cryptocurrency, discrete choice modeling, and human capabilities, to name a few.   

Professor Follett teaches courses relating to probability, statistical programming, generalized linear models, and data mining. In addition, she enjoys teaching the data analytics capstone course which partners students with a company to use real-life data to solve real-life problems. Reproducible research and analytics is something she implements into teaching whenever she can. 

Outside of work, Professor Follett enjoys cooking, gardening, traveling, and spending time with friends and family. She has two very cute cats, Franklin and Ginger.
